<h2>How to Use myGRaCE</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Where to begin<br/>
		<p>If you are worried about your personal safety, start with <b>'My Safety'</b><br/>
		If instead you wish to explore how things in your life are affecting your wellbeing and could impact on your personal safety, start with <b>'My Life'</b></p>

		If you select <b>'My Safety'</b>
		<p>Some screening questions will appear for you to answer. Please answer them all.<br/>
		Then select 'save and see My Profile'</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		On the <b>'My Profile'</b> page you can view your wellbeing and safety profile and any highlighted issues.<br/>
		If you select 'highlighted issues,' myGRaCE will invite you to explore them further by taking you to the relevant part of <b>'My Life'</b>.

		Here are some tips to help you:
		<ul>
			<li>You don't have to answer all the questions – just do what is relevant to you today</li>
			<li>Questions don't have to be answered in any particular order – it's up to you</li>
			<li>Don't agonise over what number to choose in the 0-11 scale questions – go with your immediate gut feeling</li>
			<li>You can add your thoughts and ideas about managing issues using the comments and self-management boxes next to each question</li>
			<li>To display fewer questions on screen - select topics one at a time from the list on left-hand side of the screen </li>
			<li>Take regular breaks – use the 'suspend' button </li>
			<li>Save your answers regularly</li>
			<li>When you have finished, go <b>'Home'</b> to view your profile.</li>
		</ul>

		Then go to <b>'myGRaCE Advice and My Plan'</b> <br/><br/>
		Where you can find advice about further information, sources of help and actions you can take to improve your wellbeing and personal safety.<br/></br>
