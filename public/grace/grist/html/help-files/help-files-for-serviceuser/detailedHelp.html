<h2>Here is how myGRiST works:</h2>
<p>
myGRiST contains expert knowledge about how to assess and manage your mental health so that you stay safe and well. You can provide any information for the assessment in any order by selecting links and answering questions as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The <i>'Home'</i> button takes you to the front-page mind map that has the GRiST logo in the middle and coloured boxes for each of the topics you can explore in myGRiST. Every box can be selected (clicked) except the grey one.</li>
	<li>Select a topic and it will take you to a different screen where you can answer the questions relating to that topic.</li>
	<li>In this new screen, the questions are organised in a list with different layers (what we call a  "tree") on the left, for easy access to any part of the information. If you select (click) the very top item, all questions associated with the topic will appear in the right part of the screen.</li>
	<li>If you only want to view a particular subtopic in the tree, select that item and only the questions relating to it, and any items that are inside it, will be displayed.</li>
	<li>Selecting the little '+' sign by an item will open up the subtopics it contains within it. If you want them all opened up, then right-click the mouse to "expand" (open) or "collapse" (close) the tree for that item.</li>
	<li>In the right-hand part of the screen, you can answer all the questions associated with the selected item in the left-hand tree. 
	<li>Every question has some little pictures or icons next to it. You can find out what they do by putting the cursor over the top of them without clicking or by selecting the <i>'Key'</i> button in the top part of the screen.</li>
	<li>In this same top part of the screen is a progress bar that tells you the percentage of questions you have answered in the particular topic of the tree you have selected:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li> if you select the very top item, it will count all questions in the tree;</li>
	  <li> if you select an item further down, only the questions associated with this or any items within it will be counted.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Information can be collected in any order you like and you can easily move to different parts by going back to the front mind map using the 'Home' button and selecting a new one. </li>
	<li>Remember to save your answers regularly.</li>
	<li>There is no need to fill in everything; it's your tool and you can do whatever you wish with it. If you want to take a break and finish it later, select the <i>'Suspend Assessment'</i> button.</li>
	<li>When you have collected all the information that is important to you today, click the <i>'Assess'</i> button (top right hand of screen) to make an overall assessment of your risks and safety.</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>it is a good idea to explain why you have given a particular risk rating, especially if it is on the high side;</li> 
	  <li>similarly, making a self-management plan in the "action" box would be helpful.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The <i>'Finish'</i> button (top right of screen) takes you to a summary table of your assessment and management plans:
	  <ul>
	    <li>it will contain your risk ratings and the accompanying comments you gave for each one, if any, in the 'Assess' button screen;</li>
	    <li>in the "Overall Assessment Comment" box at the bottom, you might want to say something about the particular circumstances of this assessment: who did you do it with, where, etc.</li>
	    <li>if you want to change anything, you can use the <i>'Cancel'</i> button to return to your assessment;</li>
	    <li>if you are satisfied with the information you have given and want to finish the assessment, select <i>'Finish Assessment'</i>.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li>The <i>'Advice and Support'</i> button (top of screen) provides web links to information and advice about the range of topics GRiST covers e.g. about loneliness, debt, mood and food, alcohol, or benefits. A list of helpline numbers and websites is provided along with advice about getting help and what to do in the event of an emergency.</li>
