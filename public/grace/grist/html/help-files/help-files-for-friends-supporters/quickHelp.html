self harm, harm to others, etc) and how to address each one: the
specific risk judgements and action plans.

		This is where the basic data collection takes place for options
    selected on the home page (Full Life, Wellbeing, and Safety).
    Data can be provided in any order by selecting topics from the
    mind map. This will take you to all the questions within that
    topic.  You can switch to and from the mind map and the associated
    questions to follow the flow of discussions with the person you
    are assessing.  When you are ready to rate the person's risks,
    select the My Safety Assessment button. This lets you provide your
    levels of risks along with the reasons for them and the specific
    actions to reduce them.

</ul>

<i>Stage 2</i> is for considering the GRaCE advice and drawing up your own
plan for managing the person's mental health and safety. Select the
"GRaCE Advice and My Plan" button when you get to this stage. The
GRaCE advice will provide some ideas and contacts for help but you
will be able to draw up your own more specific plan using the
structured categories in the My Action Plan box.
