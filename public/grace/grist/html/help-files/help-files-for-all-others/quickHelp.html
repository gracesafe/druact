<i>Stage 1</i> diagnosing or assessing the levels of risk in each
category (suicide, self harm, harm to others, etc) and how to address
each one: the specific risk judgements and action plans.
<ol>
	<li>This is where the basic data collection takes place, which can
  be for the varying contexts of assessments that are selected on the
  home page (screening, full, repeat, etc).</li>
	<li>Data can be provided in any order by selecting topics from the
  mind map. This will take you to all the questions within that
  topic.</li>
	<li>You can switch to and from the mind map and the questions to
  follow your own thought processes or the flow of the assessment if
  you are collecting data during it.</li>
	<li>When you are ready to provide a risk judgement for one or more
  risks, select the <i>Risk Judgement</i> button. This lets you provide
  your levels of risks along with the reasons for them and the specific
  actions to reduce them.</li>
</ol>

<i>Stage 2</i> is entered using the <i>Risk Formulation</i> button.
<ol>
	<li>The default categories help organise risk and safety information
  into immediate, medium, and long-term impact.</li>
	<li>This organisation helps bridge between levels of risk and their
  overall phased management.</li>
</ol>

<i>Stage 3</i> is the final stage, selected by the <i>SafetyPlan</i> button. 
<ol>
	<li>The safety plan brings together information and actions for
  each risk into a cohesive overall plan.</li>
	<li>It summarises what needs to happen for the patient and informs
  referral information such as letters to GPs or specialist services.</li>
