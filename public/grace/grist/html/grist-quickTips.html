<h3>Providing scores for items with a zero to ten scale</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use the descriptors at each end of the scale for a clear
  definition of how to interpret the maximum and minimum values.</li>
	<li>Give the value that feels right and do not agonise about it
  because it will not improve your intuitive judgement.</li>
	<li>If a particular behaviour or circumstance is not a problem, then
  put a zero: it is not contributing to the risks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<ol>
	<li><i>Only</i> provide a comment if it adds to the understanding of that
  risk item and does not simply repeat what the quantitative answer
  communicates.</li>
	<ol type="a"><li>There is <i>no</i> necessity to provide a comment for every question.</li></ol>
	<li>Focus comments on the specific question to which they are attached.</li>
	<li>Comments should be brief and to the point: a single short
  sentence is usually enough or, even better, a key phrase that
  communicates the issue.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Actions or management plans</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Always put something in the action box if it will help manage
  the risk issue.</li>
	<li>Only put something in the action box if it relates to that
  specific item.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Tips for individual risks</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Providing the risk-judgement score</li>
	<ol type="a">
			<li>Always give a risk judgement unless it is a repeat assessment
		  and you have switched that risk off.</li>
			<li>The risk judgement is in the context of the normal level of
		  risks applying to the person's general population (e.g. working-age
		  adults, older adults, or young children). Nobody is risk free but
		  the idea behind the zero for a risk judgement is that it is no
		  different to what one would expect from people in general.</li>
			<li>The risk judgement should apply to the service-user's current
		  circumstances or the new circumstances if these will immediately
		  change following the assessment (e.g. because the person is being
		  discharged).</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Providing a risk summary for each risk</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Use the risk summary box to bring out the key factors that have
  influenced your judgement of the level of risk.</li>
		<li>State <i>only</i> those factors that are important for understanding
  why you gave the particular risk judgement. </li>
	</ol>
	
	<li>Managing the risk</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Use the tab for copying into the management box relevant actions you
  gave earlier for specific questions.</li>
		<li>Only provide a management plan that relates to this specific
  risk.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>



<h3>Risk formulation</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The purpose of the risk formulation is to connect the
  symptoms of risks, their causes, and the timescales of managing
  them. </li>
	<li>The risk formulation should make it easier to ensure the
  management plan tackles the most urgent immediate problems as well
  as the longer term reasons for those problems. </li>
</ol>


<h3>Overall risk and safety management</h3>
<ol>
	<li>When you have evaluated each risk, answered the general
  questions relating to all risks, and provided a risk
  formulation, it is time to produce the risk plan for the complete
  assessment.</li>
	<li>Collate your summary management plans for each assessed risk
  with actions from the general questions to produce your overall
  safety plan. </li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>The management tab has a mechanism for copying risk plans and
  general actions into the safety plan text box.</li>
		<li>After selecting and copying appropriate ones, edit the box as required. </li>
	</ol>
