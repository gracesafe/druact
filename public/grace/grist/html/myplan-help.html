<h3>Making Your Self-Management Plan</h3>
The following steps may be helpful to you:
<ol>
<li>
Take a look at your personalised myGRiST report and identify aspects of your life which you can change, and which you wish to work on to improve your safety and wellbeing. Pick just a couple to start with and write them down.
<br/><br/>
The areas I want to work on are:
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Think about any improvements you have made in these areas in the past which have made you feel better and safer. What did you do? What did you find helpful? Write this down. 
<br/><br/>Things which helped me in the past are:
</li>
<br/>

For each area you wish to work on, think about what ‘improvement’ would look like for you. For example, if drinking too much alcohol is having a bad effect on your life, ‘improvement’ for you might mean not drinking alone at home. Write your ideas down.

<br/><br/>The improvements I want to make are:
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Then set yourself a realistic target, or series of targets for improvement. For example, if you are drinking too much alcohol alone at home, you might want to cut down by one drink per day for the next week. 
<br/>
If your days lack structure, you might want to introduce one new daily activity, like taking a 20 minute walk every day for the next week. 
<br/>
Don’t set too many targets or make them over-ambitious. Targets need to be meaningful and achievable, and ones where you can easily measure success. Write your targets down.
<br/><br/>My targets are:
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Think about what you need to help you plan and make these changes. This might include:
<ol>
<li>more information about a topic - follow the topic help links within myGRiST</li>
<li>having someone to agree your targets with and to encourage you to achieve them. Think about who you trust and who would be willing to help you.</li>
<li>professional help – see myGRiST’s referral  advice </li>
<li>equipment, such as  a map of the area, a pair of walking shoes or a wall chart to record your progress on.</li>
