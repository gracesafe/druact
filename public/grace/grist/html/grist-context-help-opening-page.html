<p>There are different types of assessment depending on the context
  of assessment and the patient circumstances. These types are
  explained below but, in general, all assessments using this dynamic
  interface provide:</p>

<ol>
	<li>flexibility to enter patient information in any order, to
  reflect the structure of patients' narratives about their
  circumstances;</li>
	<li>a graphical overview of the content of GRiST;</li>
	<li>information on the basis of which to create a risk formulation
  and a safety management plan for a patient, in addition to making
  clinical risk judgments about them;</li>
	<li>a colour-coded output report highlighting where risk is accruing
  in a patient's profile, along with a risk formulation and detailed
  patient safety management plan;</li>
	<li>a comprehensive model of information required to both assess and
  manage risks associated with mental health problems.</li>
	<li>A series of updated output reports which can be reviewed in the
  GRiST dashboard. Graphs of changing risk levels and contributing
  factors can be produced using the 'Risk History' button. (This
  functionality is available for any patient with more than one
  assessment stored in the GRiST database, irrespective of assessment
  mode.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>The different types of assessment</h3>
<p><b>Screening</b><br>A rapid assessment of patient safety based on
  the key questions mental health experts use when evaluating
  risk. These questions have been identified through analysis of the
  GRiST database containing nearly one million completed assessments
  and associated clinical risk judgments.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the screening version if the focus is on an initial
  evaluation of risk levels rather than how to manage them.</li>
  <ol type="a">
	  	<li>When time is limited</li>
	  	<li>When you are concerned about a patient's immediate safety</li>
	  	<li>When you are in a front-line service (e.g. IAPT, A&amp;E or a GP
	  practice) and wish to establish a patient's safety before referring
	  them on to another service where a full GRiST (or other risk
	  assessment) will be undertaken.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>There are two versions of screening tool, one showing all the
  questions and one just the screening questions.</li>
  <ol  type="a">
  	<li><i>Screening: All Questions Available</i></li>
  		<ol type="i">
  			<li>Answer all questions that show up in bold with a "screening" label in front.</li>
  			<li>Use when you want flexibility to add additional information
			  patients disclose, so that you have the option for providing more
			  than just the screening questions if desired and appropriate.</li>
  		</ol>
  	<li><i>Screening: Only Screening Questions Available</i></li>
  	<ol type="i">
  		<li>Use when time is limited and you want rapid access to the
  screening questions only.</li>
  		<li>If you change your mind and want to see additional questions,
  you can always return to the Home Page and select the alternative
  screening tool.</li>
  	</ol>
  </ol>
</ol>


<p><b>Full assessment</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>The focus is on both evaluating and managing the risks.</li>
	<li>It is often used after an initial screening.</li>
	<li>All risks should be assessed if it is the first full
  assessment.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Repeat assessments</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Provides access to the full set of risks and data but you do not
  have to review every risk; some risks need more frequent updating
  than others, which varies with each patient and changing
  circumstances.</li>
	<li>Switch off risks that are not being reviewed so that their
  most recent evaluation will be pulled into the new assessment report
  and thus still visible even though not assessed this time.</li>
	<li>It is up to you and/or your organisation to decide how often a
  risk needs to be reassessed.</li>
  <ol type="a">
  	<li>Keep an eye on when each risk was last assessed.</li>
  	<li>Make sure a repeat assessment is done within the agreed maximum
  time lapse.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p><b>Rapid repeat assessments</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>These are conducted when only those items that can change on a
  daily basis are reviewed.</li>
	<li>It provides easy access to these items, which are the questions with no padlock icons.</li>
	<li>The new "dynamic" version of GRiST has the functionality for
  showing only these questions and makes the assessment very quick.</li>
	<li>Use</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>when frequent and regular assessments are required for patients
  (e.g. for inpatients under observation for suicidal behaviour).</li>
		<li>when you only need to assess items that can change often and at
  any time.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

<p><b>Sequential GRiST interface</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Use if you are not recording assessments in real time with the
  service user but are providing the data after an assessment and want
  to answer questions in a fixed order.</li>
	<li>Questions are laid out in exactly the same order as for the
  original GRiST interface.</li>
	<li>The only difference from the original interface is that the
  hierarchical knowledge structure is visible alongside the questions
  and can be used to jump to different areas more efficiently if
  required.</li>
</ol>
